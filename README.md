Researcher Navigator can be used to get the landscape of who is publishing in a given research field.

You can access it at:

It uses the search terms to pull the abstract data from Pubmed, and for a given search it checks the main authors publishing and how the abstract keywords differ from the remaining researchers.

In addition it builds a network representing the collaborations between the researchers.

It could be used to get to know who works in a field and, for instance, to find reviewers for your papers or grants.
